# Systems Practice
This is a repo to use while I practice Systems Programming

## Projects
Languages
- C
- C++
- Rust
- Zig
- Assembly

### 1. **Hello, World! and Basic I/O**
   - **Overview**: Start by writing simple programs that print "Hello, World!" to the console and read input from the user.
   - **Skills**: Syntax familiarity, basic input/output operations, compiling, and running programs.
   - **Technologies/Frameworks**: Standard libraries for I/O in each language (e.g., `stdio.h` in C, `iostream` in C++, etc.).

### 2. **Simple Calculator**
   - **Overview**: Create a command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   - **Skills**: Arithmetic operations, control structures (if-else, switch-case), basic functions.
   - **Technologies/Frameworks**: Standard math libraries.

### 3. **File I/O Operations**
   - **Overview**: Develop a program that reads from and writes to files. For instance, a program that copies content from one file to another.
   - **Skills**: File handling, error handling, working with pointers (C/C++), and understanding file descriptors.
   - **Technologies/Frameworks**: Standard file I/O libraries.

### 4. **Custom Memory Allocator**
   - **Overview**: Implement a basic memory allocator (like `malloc` and `free`).
   - **Skills**: Dynamic memory allocation, pointers, data structures (linked lists).
   - **Technologies/Frameworks**: Understanding of the heap, memory management libraries.

### 5. **Simple Shell**
   - **Overview**: Create a simple Unix-like shell that can execute commands and handle basic features like command history.
   - **Skills**: Process creation and management, system calls, string parsing, basic data structures.
   - **Technologies/Frameworks**: `fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()` system calls in Unix.

### 6. **Basic HTTP Server**
   - **Overview**: Build a basic HTTP server that can handle GET requests and serve static files.
   - **Skills**: Socket programming, understanding of HTTP protocol, multi-threading.
   - **Technologies/Frameworks**: Sockets API, threading libraries.

### 7. **Virtual Memory Manager**
   - **Overview**: Implement a simple virtual memory manager that handles paging and basic memory protection.
   - **Skills**: Understanding of virtual memory, page tables, hardware abstraction.
   - **Technologies/Frameworks**: Operating system concepts, memory management.

### 8. **Thread Library Implementation**
   - **Overview**: Create a simple threading library that provides basic thread creation, joining, and synchronization (mutexes, condition variables).
   - **Skills**: Concurrency, thread management, synchronization mechanisms.
   - **Technologies/Frameworks**: `pthread` library (for reference), synchronization primitives.

### 9. **Compiler for a Simple Language**
   - **Overview**: Write a compiler for a simple programming language, covering lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation.
   - **Skills**: Compiler theory, finite automata, grammars, intermediate representations.
   - **Technologies/Frameworks**: Lex and Yacc (for C/C++), other parser generators.

### 10. **Operating System Kernel Module**
   - **Overview**: Develop a simple kernel module for a Unix-like operating system that interacts with kernel-space components.
   - **Skills**: Kernel programming, hardware interaction, low-level programming.
   - **Technologies/Frameworks**: Linux kernel development environment, kernel APIs.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Documentation and Testing**: Throughout all projects, emphasize good documentation practices and rigorous testing (unit tests, integration tests).
- **Version Control**: Use version control systems (like Git) to manage your code and track your progress.
- **Debugging and Profiling**: Learn to use debugging tools (GDB for C/C++, LLDB for Rust) and profiling tools to analyze performance.
